## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **‚öôÔ∏è Flexible Email Content Creation**:
    *   **Upload Templates**: Use existing `.html`, `.htm`, `.md`, or `.txt` files. Markdown is automatically converted to HTML. Plain text is wrapped nicely.
    *   **Draft In-App**: Utilize the **Quill Rich Text Editor** for easy formatting or switch to the **HTML Source** tab for precise control.
*   **üìß Multiple Recipient Modes**:
    *   **Bulk Sending**: Upload a `.csv` file. Requires an email column (looks for `email`, `email address`, etc., case-insensitive).
    *   **Single Recipient**: Quickly send a test or one-off email by typing the address directly.
*   **üé® Dynamic Personalization**:
    *   Use placeholders like `$name` or `${header}` in your subject and email body (matching your CSV column headers) for personalized messages. **(See 'Using Variables' section below)**
*   **üñºÔ∏è Live Email Preview**:
    *   Instantly see how your drafted or uploaded content will render before sending. (Note: Placeholders are not substituted in the preview).
*   **üìé Attachment Support**:
    *   Easily attach one or more files to your emails.
*   **üë§ Custom Sender Name**:
    *   Optionally override the default sender display name (set in `.env`) for specific campaigns.
*   **‚úâÔ∏è HTML & Plain Text**:
    *   Automatically generates both HTML and plain text versions of your email for compatibility across different email clients using `html2text`.
*   **üîê Secure Configuration**:
    *   Keep your SMTP credentials safe using a `.env` file. No hardcoding needed.
    *   Supports standard SMTP servers and ports, including TLS.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

*   **Python**: Version 3.7 or newer recommended (due to Flask 2.x+ dependencies).
*   **pip**: Python package installer (usually comes with Python).
*   **Git**: For cloning the repository.
*   **(Optional but Recommended)** A Python virtual environment manager (`venv`).

### üöÄ Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SupratimRK/web-bulk-email-sender.git
    cd web-bulk-email-sender
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:
    *   **macOS / Linux**:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   **Windows (Command Prompt/PowerShell)**:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *(Your terminal prompt should now indicate you're in the `(venv)`)*

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables**:
    *   **Copy the example file**:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
        *(On Windows, you might use `copy .env.example .env`)*
    *   **Edit the `.env` file** with your actual SMTP credentials and desired default display name. See the section below for details.

### üîí Environment Variables (`.env` File)

Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory (where `app.py` is located) and add the following variables:

```dotenv
# .env - DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE TO GIT!

# Display Name shown in the 'From' field by default (can be overridden in UI)
display_name="Your Default Sender Name"

# Your sending email address (must match SMTP login)
sender_email="your_email@example.com"

# Your email account password or an App Password (Recommended!)
password="your_password_or_app_password"

# SMTP Server Configuration (Examples below)
MAILER_HOST="smtp.yourprovider.com" # e.g., smtp.gmail.com, smtp.mailersend.net
MAILER_PORT="587"                   # Common ports: 587 (TLS), 465 (SSL), 25 (Insecure)

# Flask Secret Key (for session management, flash messages)
# Change this to a random string for better security
FLASK_SECRET_KEY="a_default_but_less_secure_key_please_change_me"
```

**Important Notes**:

*   **Security**: **NEVER** commit your `.env` file to version control (Git). The `.gitignore` file should ideally prevent this, but always be cautious.
*   **App Passwords**: If using Gmail or some other providers, it's highly recommended (or required) to enable 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) and generate an **App Password** specifically for this application instead of using your main account password.
    *   [Gmail App Passwords Guide](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en)
*   **SMTP Settings**: Ensure `MAILER_HOST` and `MAILER_PORT` are correct for your email provider. The code currently uses STARTTLS for port 587. If using port 465 (implicit SSL), the `smtplib.SMTP_SSL` class might be needed instead (requires code adjustment).

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Start the Flask Application**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The application will start, usually on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` or `http://0.0.0.0:5000/` (accessible on your local network). Open the URL in your web browser.

2.  **Choose Content Source**:
    *   Select "Draft Email Below" to use the editor.
    *   Select "Upload Template File" to browse for an `.html`, `.md`, or `.txt` file.

3.  **Create/Upload Email Content**:
    *   **If Drafting**: Use the Rich Text Editor or switch to the "HTML Source" tab.
    *   **If Uploading**: Select your template file.

4.  **Set Subject & Sender Name**:
    *   Enter the **Email Subject**. You can use placeholders here (e.g., `Welcome, $name!`). See **"How the Subject is Determined"** below.
    *   Optionally, enter a **Sender Display Name** to override the default from `.env`.

5.  **Choose Recipient Method**:
    *   Select "Bulk (Upload CSV)".
    *   Select "Single Recipient".

6.  **Provide Recipients**:
    *   **If Bulk**: Upload your `.csv` file. See **"Example CSV File"** below.
    *   **If Single**: Enter the recipient's email address in the input field.

7.  **Add Attachments (Optional)**:
    *   Click "Choose Files" and select one or more files to attach.

8.  **Preview (Recommended)**:
    *   Click the "Preview" button to see how the email body will look. Check formatting, especially if using Markdown or complex HTML. (Placeholders are not replaced in the preview).

9.  **Send**:
    *   Click the "Send Email(s)" button. A loading indicator will appear.

10. **Review Results**:
    *   You'll be redirected to the results page.
    *   Check the summary status in the flash message and the navbar.
    *   Review the detailed log for the status of each individual email (Success, Failed, Skipped). Error messages will be shown for failures.

11. **Go Back**: Click "Go Back & Send More" to return to the main form.

## üìÑ Example CSV File for Bulk Sending

When using the "Bulk (Upload CSV)" option, your CSV file structure is crucial.

*   **Required Header**: It **MUST** contain a column header for email addresses. The application looks for common names like `email`, `email address`, `email_address`, `e-mail`, or `recipient` (case-insensitive). It will also try to find any header containing `mail` if the common ones aren't present.
*   **Optional Headers**: Any other column headers can be used as variables for personalization in your subject and email body.
*   **Encoding**: UTF-8 encoding (with or without BOM) is recommended. Latin-1 is supported as a fallback.
*   **Delimiter**: Standard comma (`,`) delimiter is expected. The app attempts to sniff the dialect but defaults to comma-separated.

**Example `recipients.csv` file:**

```csv
Email,FirstName,LastName,Product,DiscountCode
alice@example.com,Alice,Smith,SuperWidget,SUMMER20
bob@domain.org,Bob,Jones,MegaGadget,WELCOME10
charlie@email.net,Charlie,Brown,TurboTool,
diana@sample.co,Diana,Prince,SuperWidget,SAVEBIG5
,"","",,""  # Example of a potentially empty row (will be skipped)
frank@test.io,Frank,,,SAVE15 # Example with missing data
```

**Key points from the example:**

*   The `Email` column is present and contains the recipient addresses.
*   `FirstName`, `LastName`, `Product`, `DiscountCode` are optional headers used for personalization.
*   Some rows might have missing data (like Charlie's DiscountCode or Frank's LastName/Product). The corresponding placeholder will be replaced with an empty string.
*   Empty rows are skipped automatically.

## üîë Understanding Variables & Personalization

You can personalize both the **Subject** and the **Email Body** using data from your CSV file (when in Bulk mode).

*   **Syntax**: Use `$` followed by the header name (e.g., `$firstname`) OR `${header_name}` (e.g., `${product}`). The curly brace syntax `${...}` is useful if the placeholder is immediately followed by other characters that could be mistaken as part of the name (e.g., `${product}s`).
*   **Matching**: The placeholder name **MUST** exactly match a column header in your CSV file, but the match is **case-insensitive**. So, `$firstname`, `$FirstName`, and `${FIRSTNAME}` will all correctly pull data from the `FirstName` column in the example CSV above.
*   **Replacement**: Before sending each email, the application replaces every placeholder it finds with the corresponding value from that recipient's row in the CSV.
*   **Missing Data**: If a placeholder exists in your template but the corresponding column is missing in the CSV or the cell is empty for a specific recipient, the placeholder will be replaced with an empty string (nothing).

**Example Usage (based on the CSV above):**

*   **Subject Input**: `Special Offer for $FirstName on ${Product}!`
    *   For Alice: `Special Offer for Alice on SuperWidget!`
    *   For Bob: `Special Offer for Bob on MegaGadget!`
*   **Email Body Content (HTML example)**:
    ```html
    <p>Hi $FirstName $LastName,</p>
    <p>Thanks for your interest in the ${Product}. As a valued customer, use code <strong>$DiscountCode</strong> for a special discount!</p>
    <p>Best regards,<br>The Team</p>
    ```
    *   For Alice: Renders with "Hi Alice Smith," ... "code SUMMER20..."
    *   For Charlie: Renders with "Hi Charlie Brown," ... "code ..." (empty string for DiscountCode)

**Important**: Variables are **NOT** replaced in the live Preview. The preview shows the raw template with placeholders intact.

## ü§î How the Email Subject is Determined

The application follows this logic to set the subject line for each email:

1.  **User Input Field**: If you type anything into the "Email Subject" field on the form, that text is used as the template. Placeholders (like `$FirstName`) within this input *will* be processed using the CSV data for each recipient.
2.  **`<title>` Tag (HTML Upload/Draft)**: If the "Email Subject" field is **left empty** AND the email content is determined to be HTML (either uploaded `.html`/`.htm` or drafted HTML), the application looks for a `<title>Your Subject Here</title>` tag within the HTML content. If found, the text inside the title tag is used as the subject. Placeholders are *not* processed if the subject is extracted this way.
3.  **First Non-Empty Line (Markdown/Text Upload or Fallback)**: If the subject field is empty AND no `<title>` tag is found (or the content is Markdown/Text), the application attempts to use the first non-empty, non-HTML-tag-like line from the email content as the subject. Placeholders are *not* processed if the subject is extracted this way.
4.  **Default Subject**: If none of the above methods yield a subject (e.g., the content starts immediately with HTML tags and has no title, and the subject field was empty), a generic default subject like `"Your Default Sender Name Information"` (using the `display_name` from `.env` or the custom one) will be used.

**Recommendation**: For maximum control and personalization, **always specify your desired subject in the "Email Subject" form field**, using placeholders as needed.

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
web-bulk-email-sender/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                 # Your SMTP config & secrets (!!! NOT COMMITTED !!!)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env.example         # Example environment file structure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py               # Main Flask application logic (routing, email sending)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt     # Python package dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ readme.md            # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html       # Main form UI (editor, options, preview)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ result.html      # Status/result log page
```

## üèÉ Running the App

```bash
# Ensure you are in the project directory and your virtualenv is active
python app.py
```

By default, it runs on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. The `host='0.0.0.0'` setting in `app.py` makes it accessible from other devices on your local network using your computer's local IP address (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:5000`).
